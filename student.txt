I am a student, I had no job, my monthly living expenses are for the family, I do not have money to support the rest of my interest in learning, but I like computer programming, want to have a certificate, so I applied for grants.
I grew very fond of computer programming, I want to learn how to program a computer for data analysis, and data excavated, this course gave me a good starting opportunity for me to understand the magic of the computer. Although I have learned after five special courses in four, but because the last one graduation project requires a certificate of registration before they can register, so I decided to apply for a course certificate.
As a member of this community of course, I promise that I will do my best to express my point of view, there are questions to help students solve the problem, I will comply with academic integrity, I presented text, data, opinion is definitely my own original.
hahaha
